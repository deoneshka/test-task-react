Foodify Application You need to create an application which will allow the user
to get a random recipe and give him / her an ability to save it in the favorite
dishes list. Call the API endpoint
“https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php” to fetch a random recipe
and display it on the main page. Add an ability to save or skip current recipes.
Saved recipes should be displayed on the other page (for example favorite
recipes) and will persist their state after reloading the page. Implement a
modal window with form on the favorite recipes page to allow the user create his
/ her own recipes. Each recipe has to include a title and a cooking instruction.
Task requirements You should use React for this app. API should be called once
on page load, skip button should refetch random data from API You can use any
state manager you want or not use it at all When you add custom dish, or when
API has no image, you should show placeholder Design is up to you You can use
any styling solution you want (sass, styled-components, CSS-in-JS, Tailwind) You
can use UI libraries Your app should be responsive and be able to adopt to
mobile devices Storing data in local-storage will be a plus App should be stored
on public github repo You should use gh-pages to host your project Make sure you
provide both github and gh-pages links to our HR, when you finish the project
